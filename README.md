# Red Wine Quality

For this project we will be using machine learning algorithms to determine which physicochemical features classify a wine as ‘bad’, ‘medium’ or ‘good’ quality, as well as predicting the quality score from  0-10. We will make predictions on the datasets ‘quality’ column using KNN algorithm. We will be using classification modeling to evaluate the wine dataset. In addition, we will use Random Forest and Logistic Regression methods to compare the accuracy of KNN algorithm.
